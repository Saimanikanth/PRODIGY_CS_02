PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION.

**PIXEL MANIPULATION**
Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves transforming the pixel values of an image to make it unrecognizable and secure from unauthorized access. There are several methods to achieve this, ranging from simple techniques to more complex algorithms. Basic Pixel Manipulation Techniques are
**a. Pixel Shuffling**
Pixel shuffling involves rearranging the pixels of an image based on a predefined or random sequence. This can be done using a permutation matrix.
**b. XOR Encryption**
This method uses the XOR operation between the pixel values and a key.

**Encryption**
It is nothing but a simple process in which we convert our data or information into secret code to prevent it from unauthorized access and keep it private and secure. First, we will select an image, and then we will convert that image into a byte array due to which the image data will be totally converted into numeric form, and then we can easily apply the XOR operation to it. Now, whenever we will apply the XOR function on each value of the byte array then the data will be changed due to which we will be unable to access it. But we should remember one thing here our encryption key plays a very important role without that key we can not decrypt our image. It acts as a password to decrypt it.

**Decryption**
It is nothing but a process of converting our encrypted data into a readable form. Here we will again apply the same XOR operation on an encrypted image to decrypt it. But always remember that our encryption key and decryption key must be the same.
